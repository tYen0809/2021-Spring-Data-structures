Request : 
1.Insert an integer data in the binary search tree (BST). 
After the insertion, use a "recursive approach" to traverse the tree  by the "inorder sequence" 
and print the sequence (it should be  in nondecreasing order) (V) 

2. k integer data, which are generated randomly within a specified range assigned by the user,
can be inserted into the BST. After these k integers are inserted, 
traverse the tree by "inorder sequence" and print the sequence (V) 

3. Delete an integer number from BST (assigned by user) (V) (with non-recursive)

4. Search an target integer in the BST (V)

5. Traverse the BST recursively to obtain the  (V)

	4.1 inorder sequence;

	4.2 preorder sequence;

	4.3 postorder sequence;

6. Traverse the BST to obtain the levelorder sequence (V)



Bonus : 
1. Clean BST
2. Non-recursive: 
	2.1 inorder sequence;

	2.2 preorder sequence;

	2.3 postorder sequence;

	2.4 Delete

	2.5 Insert
